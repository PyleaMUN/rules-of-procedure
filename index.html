<h1>Pylea Model United Nations<br>Rules of Procedure</h1>
</div>
<p class="intro">The following rules apply to all committees at PyleaMUN, unless otherwise noted by the Chair. The rules for Crisis committees may be found in the background guides. These rules have been annotated for your reference, and are subject to change before conference.</p>
        <!-- === Rules === -->

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;1&nbsp;&ndash; Language</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>English shall be the only working language of the conference. By working language, we mean the language that delegates use in committee sessions and caucuses. We allow delegates to use phrases from languages other than English in speeches, but the content of the speech must be understandable to all delegates. We strongly oppose the use of affected accents, which are found by many to be wholly unnecessary and often insulting.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;2&nbsp;&ndash; Courtesy</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>Delegates shall show courtesy and respect to all staff and delegates. Delegates shall be attentive to those who hold the floor and shall maintain decorum during all sessions of the Committee. The Moderator shall call to order immediately all delegates who fail to comply with this rule.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;3&nbsp;&ndash; Credentials</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>Every registered delegation has had its credentials reviewed and accepted by the Secretary‑General. Challenges to the credentials of any member should be addressed in writing to the Executive Committee. We do not allow delegates to challenge each other's credentials in committee, as it causes unnecessary disruption and is impolite. When a delegate is off policy, he will be discreetly corrected by a member of the Committee staff or the Undersecretary‑General. Complaints about delegates being off policy should be made directly to the Executive Committee.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;4&nbsp;&ndash; Non‑Members</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>Representatives of Accredited Observers shall have all the rights of Members, except those of voting on resolutions or amendments. A representative of a state or organization which is neither an Accredited Observer nor a Member of the United Nations may address the Committee only with the approval of the Chair and a majority of the Committee.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;5&nbsp;&ndash; Statements by the Secretariat</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>The Secretary‑General or any representative of the Secretariat may address the Committee at any time, superseding all other rules of procedure.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;6&nbsp;&ndash; Staff</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>The Secretary‑General shall appoint the Undersecretaries‑General, Chairs, Moderators, Assistant Chairs, Information Staff, and Administrative Staff, who shall hold office until the close of the Conference.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;7&nbsp;&ndash; Duties and Powers of the Committee Staff</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>The Committee Staff includes a Chair, a Moderator, and a number of Assistant Chairs. The Chair shall open and close each session and may limit speaking time, limit the speakers list, and decide the propriety of any procedural motion. The Chair also has the final word on all substantive matters of the Committee.</p>
                <p>The Moderator shall direct debate, grant the right to speak, put questions, announce decisions on points of order, and ensure and enforce observance of these rules of procedure. The Chair and Assistant Chairs may advise delegates on the course of debate. If the Chair is absent, the Moderator shall assume all duties of the Chair. If the Moderator is absent, the Chair or a designated member of the Committee Staff shall assume all functions of the Moderator. The Chair may also temporarily transfer moderating duties to another member of the Committee Staff at any time.</p>
                <p>In some smaller committees, Presidents and Vice Presidents take the place of Chairs, Moderators, and Assistant Chairs. In the large committees the three‑way division of labor is very efficient, as it gives the Chair more time to review substantive documents produced by the committee and answer delegates' questions on the topic areas. In smaller committees, the Chair and Moderator positions are often combined in the President. Delegates and staff are expected to interact to a greater degree in these committees, particularly during formal and informal moderated sessions. Having the same person moderate debate and run the committee allows greater access to the committee leader.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;8&nbsp;&ndash; Voting</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>Only delegates who have been recorded as present in the latest roll call may vote. A motion that requires a “simple majority” passes only if the number of delegates voting in favor of the motion exceeds the number voting against. If equal numbers vote for and against, the motion fails. A motion which requires a “two‑thirds majority” passes only if the number of delegates voting in favor of the motion equals or exceeds twice the number voting against. The number of abstentions shall not be considered in determining the results of the vote.</p>
                <p>Members may vote on both procedural issues (those that address how the committee will discuss certain topics for example, setting the agenda) and substantive issues (those that address the topic itself), while Accredited Observers may vote only on procedural issues; all eligible delegations have an equal vote. Abstentions are only in order on substantive votes. Proxy votes are not allowed. There is only one vote per delegation, not per delegate.</p>
                <p>Placard votes shall be taken on substantive matters unless there is a motion made for a roll call vote. Roll call votes are not in order when deciding a procedural motion. Once the Committee enters voting procedure, only points of order concerning the conduct of voting and points of personal privilege will be accepted. During voting on amendments and resolutions, absolute decorum will be maintained, the chamber will be secured, and no one but a member of the Secretariat or Hotel Management may enter or exit the room except in cases of emergency.</p>
                <p>Depending on the motion, a simple majority or two‑thirds majority vote may be required. The rules clearly define what majority is required to pass each motion. Two‑thirds majorities are required on some motions to allow the minority to retain a voice in proceedings. The method of calculating majorities is conventional, and is taken from Robert's Rules of Order. Unlike some older variants of parliamentary procedure, abstentions are not counted for determining a two‑thirds majority on a question. This encourages promptness, but also adds an incentive for tardy delegations to register with the dais when they arrive, allowing for accurate attendance reports.</p>
                <p>An attempt is usually made to warn all delegates caucusing outside the chamber when a move to Close Debate is imminent, but such a warning is not always possible. Therefore, it behooves the individual delegate to keep up with the formal debate and not lose voting privileges on an important issue by ignoring parliamentary proceedings. We request the assistance of advisors in keeping voting procedures solemn and dignified by obeying these procedures and encouraging their students to do the same.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;9&nbsp;&ndash; Quorum and Roll Call</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>The Chair may declare the Committee open when at least one‑quarter of the Members are present. The presence of a quorum shall be assumed unless specifically challenged. Any delegate may call for quorum if its presence is in doubt, at which point a placard count of delegates is taken. A roll call at the start of each session is required and will determine the presence of a quorum. The most common failure to achieve quorum is immediately following the expiration of a caucus, at which time either the caucus is extended if the Chair deems it productive, or an attempt is made to gather delegates back into the chambers. PyleaMUN never dismisses a committee for the remainder of a session or even part of a session because quorum could not be maintained.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;10&nbsp;&ndash; Agenda</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>The first task of the Committee shall be the determination of the order of topics on the agenda. Generally, the first motion made when the Committee is called to order is a motion to set the agenda, in the form “I move that topic X be placed first on the agenda.” The motion to set the agenda requires a second and is debatable. Debate may proceed until it is formally closed. The Chair may limit the speakers' list at his discretion, but a minimum of two speakers in favor and two against must be heard before a motion to close debate is in order.</p>
                <p>When debate is closed, the Committee will move to an immediate vote on the motion. A simple majority is necessary for passage. Since it is a procedural motion, abstentions are not in order. If the motion passes, the topic area named in the motion is put first on the Committee's agenda, and debate on this topic area begins immediately. If the motion fails, and there are only two topics, the other topic area is placed first on the agenda, and debate on that topic area begins immediately. If there are more than two topics, a motion to set the agenda to another topic is acceptable; if all but one topic have been proposed and failed, the remaining topic is automatically placed first on the agenda. Please be aware that a Motion to Set the Agenda simply determines which topic the committee will debate first; it does not omit a topic from the committee's consideration.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;11&nbsp;&ndash; Debate and Speakers' List</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>After the agenda has been determined, a single continuously open speakers' list shall be established for the purposes of general debate on substantive issues. Speakers on this list may speak on the topic area being considered and any resolution currently on the floor. This speakers list shall be followed for all debate on a topic area, except when superseded by speakers' lists on procedural motions, amendments, or an informal session.</p>
                <p>A delegation may add its name to the speakers' list at any time when it is not already on the list by submitting a written request to the dais. The top of the speakers' list shall always be posted for the convenience of the Committee.</p>
                <p>Keeping a speakers' list serves a number of purposes. The speakers' list informs delegates of when speaking time is approaching, thereby giving speakers time to prepare and polish their remarks before taking the floor. It guarantees all committee members an opportunity to address the committee if they so wish. Finally, it lets the dais take care in drawing up the list: rather than responding to a sea of placards every time a speech ends, the dais is able to choose delegates at once sitting on all parts of the room and from all blocs, allowing for a fairer distribution of speaking time. Delegations may hand their names to the dais as soon as they have completed a speech to immediately be placed again on the list; however, no delegate may appear twice on the list.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;12&nbsp;&ndash; Speeches</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>No representative may address a session without having been recognized by the Moderator or Chair. The Moderator or Chair may call a speaker to order if his remarks are not relevant to the topic or the issue under discussion. Speakers who fail to keep their remarks germane to the topic at hand will be called to order, usually by the dais, but sometimes by a delegate rising to a point of order on the floor. The dais will reprimand delegates who persistently interrupt valid speeches. Delegations, not delegates, are recognized to speak. Hence, a two‑person delegation may approach the microphone at one time if they desire.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;13&nbsp;&ndash; Speaking Time</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>The time allowed for speeches will be set by the Chair at his or her sole discretion. If a speaker speaks past his allotted time, the Moderator shall immediately call him to order. Speaking time begins as soon as the speaker begins his or her speech. Continuing to speak past the allotted time will not be tolerated. At any point when the floor is open, a delegate may rise to a Point of Parliamentary Inquiry and ask the Chair to change the speaking time, but this remains at the Chair's sole discretion.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;14&nbsp;&ndash; Yields</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>A delegate who has been granted the right to speak on a substantive issue (a topic area or amendment) may yield the remainder of his time to another delegate, to questions, or to the chair. Delegates speaking on procedural matters may not yield. If a speaker yields, comments on his speech are not in order.</p>
                <p>There are three types of yields:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Yielding to another delegate.</strong> The delegate who is yielded to may speak for the remaining time, but may not make any yields. Once yielded to, a delegate cannot yield again.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yielding to questions.</strong> Delegates who wish to ask questions of the speaker will raise their placards, and questioners shall be selected by the Moderator. Only the speaker's responses shall be deducted from the speaking time. There is no limit on the number of questions asked, and a delegate, if she chooses to do so, may spend her entire allotted speaking time answering questions. A delegate may refuse to answer a question at her prerogative. Questioners who try to make speeches while questioning will be called to order, as will questions put that are not germane to the issues at hand. Rhetorical questions are allowed, but must be kept brief. No dialogue is allowed during the questioning process. The best place to carry out lengthy discussions is in caucus and not in formal session.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yielding to the chair.</strong> The speaker's time will simply end.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A delegate may yield at any point during his speech, but yielding at the end of the speech is preferred. All questions regarding the legitimacy of a yield will be at the chair's discretion. Yields made to another delegate or to questions are considered an extension of the substantive speech; thus, only Points of Personal Privilege or Points of Order can interrupt them. Delegates and staff alike must be watchful during the questioning process to make sure that proper precedence is followed.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;15&nbsp;&ndash; Point of Personal Privilege</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>If at any time a delegate experiences personal discomfort which impairs his ability to participate in the proceedings, he may rise to a Point of Personal Privilege to request that the discomfort be corrected. A Point of Personal Privilege may interrupt a speech. However, the delegates are urged to exercise this right with extreme discretion.</p>
                <p>The reason that a Point of Personal Privilege is highest in precedence among all other points and motions is because it can be used to notify the Committee of emergencies threatening the safety of a specific delegate or of the assembly, and to inform the dais if the speaker cannot be heard. Only with these two purposes in mind should a delegate use a Point of Personal Privilege to interrupt a speech.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;16&nbsp;&ndash; Point of Order</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>If at any time a delegate feels that parliamentary procedure is not being followed properly, he may rise to a Point of Order. The Moderator shall immediately decide upon Points of Order according to the rules of procedure. The Moderator may dismiss those Points that are dilatory or improper. A Point of Order may interrupt a speaker only when the speech itself is not following proper parliamentary procedure. Delegates are urged to exercise this right with extreme discretion. Both delegates and staff will graciously accept corrections to procedural errors offered in a Point of Order.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;17&nbsp;&ndash; Comments</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>The Moderator may recognize two delegates other than the speaker to comment on any substantive speech. Comments are only in order after substantive speeches without yields, and are considered part of a substantive speech for purposes of precedence. Commentators may not yield and must keep their comments germane to the speech they are commenting upon.</p>
                <p>Comments take precedence over a Point of Parliamentary Inquiry. Thus, only Points of Personal Privilege and Points of Order can interrupt them. Delegates commonly fail to directly address the speech in their comments. Delegates and staff should be particularly watchful to ensure that all comments made are germane to the substantive speech they follow. Although it is possible in the second comment to refer to statements made in the first comment, this may only be done in order to discuss the original speech. It is not possible to comment on a comment.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;18&nbsp;&ndash; Point of Parliamentary Inquiry</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>If the floor is open and a delegate has a question regarding parliamentary procedure, he may rise to a Point of Parliamentary Inquiry. The question will be answered immediately by the Moderator. A Point of Parliamentary Inquiry may never interrupt a speaker. Delegates who are uncertain of the validity of a motion should inquire using a Point of Parliamentary Inquiry prior to making the motion.</p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Rule&nbsp;19&nbsp;&ndash; Right of Reply</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>A delegate whose personal or national integrity has been seriously impugned by the speech of another delegate may request a Right of Reply. All requests for a Right of Reply must be submitted in writing to the dais. The Chair's decision to grant this Right is at his sole discretion and is not appealable. The length of the reply granted is also at the Chair's discretion. A request for a Right of Reply cannot interrupt a substantive speech. A motion for a right of reply to a reply is out of order.</p>
                <p>Delegates are severely cautioned against making remarks that warrant a Right of Reply or to use a Right of Reply to utter equally belligerent statements. However, we continue to include this right since it permits impugned individuals to reassert their dignity in a civilized manner.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>A delegate may move to recess to an unmoderated informal session at any time when the floor is open, prior to closure of debate. The motioning delegate must specify a time limit for the caucus and briefly explain its purpose. The time limit is subject to the Chair's approval. The motion to recess to an unmoderated informal session shall immediately be put to a vote; a simple majority is required for passage. This motion is subject to approval by the Chair. An Unmoderated Informal Session is often referred to as an Unmoderated Caucus.</p>

                <p>A delegate may move to recess to a moderated informal session at any time when the floor is open, prior to closure of debate. The motioning delegate must specify a time limit for the caucus and a speaking time for individual speeches, as well as briefly explain its purpose. The time limit is subject to the Chair's approval. The motion to recess to moderated informal session shall immediately be put to a vote; a simple majority is required for passage. This motion is subject to approval by the Chair. A Moderated Informal Session is often referred to as a Moderated Caucus.</p>
                <p>Delegates are reminded to state the two necessary pieces of information when making either Motion for an Informal Session:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The length of time that the proposed session will last, and speaking times, if appropriate;</li>

                <p>Working papers are a means of sharing ideas on the topic with other delegates in an organized manner. A Working Paper may be, but is not required to be, in resolution format. Working papers may be copied and distributed at the Chair's discretion; he may require any number of delegates' signatures for this purpose. Signing a working paper does not necessarily signify a delegate's support for the ideas within it; rather, it merely shows the delegate's desire to see the ideas discussed by the entire committee.</p>
                <p>Delegates may propose Working Papers for the Committee's consideration in any designated topic area. Because a Working Paper cannot be formally introduced to the committee, it may not be formally amended. Instead, caucusing sessions shall be used for the purpose of combining and amending Working Papers. Working papers shall not be voted on by the Committee. <strong>No</strong> Working Papers written before the Conference will be accepted.</p>

They should pose a solution to the problem confronting the Committee and supply a rationale and historical basis. They should represent the views of a significant portion of the Committee, arrived at through debate and discussion among the Members. Passage of a resolution requires a simple majority in favor.</p>
                <p>All resolutions must be in proper format, as described in the Delegate Handbook. Resolutions may not be discussed in the Committee's substantive speeches until they have been formally introduced (see Rule 24). Once introduced, a resolution remains on the floor while the topic area it addresses is on the floor, unless an amendment or procedural debate takes precedence, or debate on the resolution is closed. The Committee may pass no more than one resolution per topic area. <strong>No</strong> resolutions written before the Conference will be accepted.</p>

Delegates may introduce a resolution when it has the approval of the Chair and has been signed by a number of Members predetermined by the Chair. Signing a resolution does not indicate support of the resolution, only a desire to see its ideas discussed; a signatory to a resolution has no further rights or obligations with respect to the resolution. There are no sponsors of resolutions.</p>
                <p>No special substantive comments are in order when a resolution is introduced, but the resolution shall immediately become subject to debate. Once a resolution has been introduced it remains on the floor and may be debated until the Committee closes debate on it, the Committee moves to the next topic area, or an amendment or procedural issue takes precedence. A resolution is considered the property of the committee. There are no individual owners or sponsors of substantive documents at PyleaMUN.</p>

            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>Amendments allow the Committee to alter any previously introduced resolution on the current topic. In order to be introduced, all amendments must be proposed in writing, bear a number of signatories predetermined by the Chair, and receive the Chair's approval.</p>
                <p>When an amendment to a resolution on the current topic area has been moved to the floor, general debate on the topic area shall be suspended. Speakers' lists shall be drawn up for and against the amendment, and all speeches must remain germane to the amendment itself. Speakers will be recognized by alternating between the two speakers' lists, beginning with the <em>for</em> speakers' list. Speeches made for and against the amendment are necessarily substantive; thus, comments and yields are in order.</p>
                <p>Debate on the amendment shall continue until a motion to close debate on the amendment is made. A motion to close debate is in order when the Committee has heard at least two speakers for and two speakers against the amendment. The amendment requires a simple majority to pass. If the amendment passes, its changes are immediately incorporated into the resolution. Once the Committee has acted upon the amendment, general debate on the topic shall resume. The preambulatory clauses of a resolution may not be amended.</p>
                <p>Amendments are considered the property of the committee. There are no individual owners or sponsors for an amendment. As there are no sponsors to resolutions, there are no "friendly" amendments.</p>

            <summary>Rule&nbsp;26&nbsp;&ndash; Introducing Amendments</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>Amendments must be signed by a prescribed number of Members and obtain the approval of the Chair before being introduced to the Committee. A delegate may introduce an amendment to any resolution on the current topic area whenever the floor is open. Amendments not approved by the Chair or dealing with resolutions not yet introduced are not in order.</p>
                <p>The Chair may rule any amendment out of order if he believes it would render the resolution nonsensical. This decision is not appealable. Amendments to amendments are not in order.</p>

            <summary>Rule&nbsp;27&nbsp;&ndash; Postponement of Debate</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>At any time after the introduction of an amendment, a delegate may move to postpone debate on the amendment. Once at least one resolution on a topic area has failed, a delegate may move to postpone debate on that topic area.</p>
                <p>The motion for postponement is debatable to the extent of one speaker for and one against and requires a two‑thirds majority for passage. If the motion passes, the amendment or topic area is postponed or "tabled" and may not be discussed until a motion for resumption of debate is passed (see Rule 28).</p>
                <p>If a topic is postponed and there are only two topics the Committee moves immediately to the second topic. If there are more than two topics, the Chair will accept a motion to Set the Agenda in order to determine which topic will be discussed next.</p>
                <p>Delegates are reminded that Postponement of Debate is only in order in debating amendments and topic areas where one resolution has already failed a vote. In effect, Postponement "tables" an issue: it sets aside a topic area or amendment when debate has grown stagnant until the committee deems it appropriate to examine the issue again (see Rule 28, Resumption of Debate). Postponement of Debate on a topic area is a serious motion and should only be put forth when the committee feels that it can no longer discuss an issue productively at that particular time.</p>

                <p>Delegates may move to resume debate on a previously postponed amendment or topic area. This motion is debatable to the extent of one speaker for and one speaker against and requires a simple majority for passage. If the motion passes, the item on which debate was postponed is again placed on the floor. The Committee may resume debate on a previously postponed topic only after it has concluded discussion of the current topic.</p>

            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>A delegate may move to close debate on an amendment, a resolution, or the selection of the agenda, after the required debate has taken place. A Motion for Closure will be accepted at the discretion of the Chair. The Chair's decision is not appealable.</p>
                <p>Closure of debate is debatable to the extent of two speakers against the motion; no speaker in favor shall be recognized. The motion requires a two‑thirds majority for passage. Once debate is closed, barring a motion for Division of the Question (see Rule 30) or for a Roll Call Vote (See Rule 31), if appropriate, the Committee moves to an immediate vote on the amendment, resolution, or agenda.</p>
                <p>Closure of debate is automatic if a particular substantive speakers' list has been exhausted, or when the specified maximum number of speakers have been heard on procedural motions. In these cases, the matter upon which debate has been closed shall be brought to an immediate vote.</p>

            <summary>Rule&nbsp;30&nbsp;&ndash; Division of the Question</summary>
            <div class="rule-body">
                <p>After debate on a resolution has been closed, a delegate may move to divide the question. Division of the question allows Members to vote on operative clauses of a resolution separately. Preambulatory clauses cannot be divided. By division of the question, delegates can remove one or more operative clauses from the resolution before it is voted on by the Committee.</p>
                <p>Once division is moved, the Moderator will ask for any objections to the motion. If there are objections, the motion will be voted upon immediately. The motion requires a simple majority for passage. If the motion fails, the Committee proceeds to an immediate vote on the resolution itself. If the motion passes, the Moderator calls for division requests.</p>
                <p>Each request must state how the operative clauses of the resolution are to be divided. The Chair can rule a division request dilatory at his discretion. After all division requests have been made, the Moderator will announce the requests in order of decreasing complexity; the requests are discussed and voted on in this order. Each division request is debatable to the extent of one speaker in favor and one against. After debate, the request is put to an immediate vote; it requires a simple majority for passage. The next most complex division request is then considered. Division requests incorporated in previously passed requests are rendered unnecessary and are therefore not discussed.</p>
                <p>If all division requests fail, the Committee proceeds to an immediate vote. After all division requests are considered and the resolution has been fully divided into a number of sections, the Committee votes on each section so divided. The sections are voted on in the order in which they appear in the resolution. A simple majority is required for the inclusion of each section in the final resolution.</p>
                <p>Once all sections have been voted on, the resolution is reconstituted to include only those operative clauses which have passed. If no operative clauses remain, the resolution fails automatically. Otherwise, the Committee votes on the reconstituted resolution as detailed in Rule 29.</p>

                <p>In a roll call vote, the Moderator shall call the roll in alphabetical order starting with a randomly selected Member of the Committee. A delegate may vote <em>Yes</em>, <em>No</em>, <em>Abstain</em>, or <em>Pass</em>. Delegates who vote <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> may request rights of explanation to explain their vote to the Committee. Delegates who <em>Pass</em> will be returned to during the second round of voting; these delegates must vote <em>Yes</em>, <em>No</em>, or <em>Abstain</em> during the second sequence, and may not request rights of explanation.</p>
                <p>After all votes have been cast, delegates who requested rights of explanation will be allowed to explain their votes within an amount of time set by the Chair. Finally, the Moderator shall announce the outcome of the vote.</p>

                <p>This motion will be accepted at the discretion of the Chair. The Chair's decision is not appealable. If the Chair accepts the motion to suspend the rules, an immediate vote will be taken. This motion requires a two‑thirds majority for passage. Delegates are urged to use this motion sparingly. The rules may be suspended to facilitate debate or to deal with unexpected occurrences. Suspensions are often used to hear an address by an expert speaker or eyewitness.</p>

A two‑thirds majority in favor of the appeal is required to overrule the decision of the Chair.</p>
                <p>The Chair's decision not to approve a resolution or amendment is never appealable.
